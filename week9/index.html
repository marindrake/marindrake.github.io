                        The window object is the global object in a browser.

                    <li>
                        Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        alert , confirm() , and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.

                    <li>
                        The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable.

                    <li>
                        The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.

                    <li>
                        The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.

                    <li>
                        You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).

                        The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.

                    <li>
                        Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.

                    <li>
                        data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.

                    <li>
                        The < audio > and < video > elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.
