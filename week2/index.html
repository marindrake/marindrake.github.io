                <h3>Ch2: Programming basics</h3>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Variables</b>
                        are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Scope</b>
                        is an important concept in programming. It refers to where a constant or variable is accessible by the program. There are two common scopes that are often referred to in programs: global scope and local scope..
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Converting</b>
                        <ol>
                            Converting Between Strings and Numbers.

                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            Converting Numbers to Strings.
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Parsing Numbers.</b>
                        There is also a useful function called parseInt() that can be used to convert a string representation of a numerical value back into a number. You can specify the base of the number you are trying to convert.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Template literals</b> can be thought of as super-powered strings as they behave in the same way as normal string literals, but with the extra power of string interpolation.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>
                  Arrays are an ordered list of values.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Arrays have lots of methods that can be used to manipulate items in the array.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sets are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of non-duplicate value.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maps are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of key-value pairs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We can use an if and else statement to control the flow of code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The switch statement can be used instead of multiple if and else statements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat a block of code while a condition is still true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A for loop works in a similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A for-of loop can be used to iterate over an array.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sets and maps are enumerable, so can also be looped over using a for-of loop.
                </li>
              </ol>
                <h3>Ch4: Functions</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other values.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Function literals can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating afunction expressionby assigning an anonymous function to a variable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All functions return a value. If this is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used like a variable inside the functionâ€™s body.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The arguments variable is an array-like object that allows access to each argument provided to the function using index notation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The rest operator can be used to access multiple arguments as an array.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Default arguments can be supplied to a function by assigning them to the parameters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous functions in ES6.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions cannot be invoked until after they are defined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A <b>callback</b> is a function that is provided as an argument to another function.
                </li>
