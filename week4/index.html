                        What happens when a form is submitted HTML?

                        Is JavaScript object based or object oriented?

                <h3>Ch8: Forms</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.
                    </li>
                    document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.
                    <li>
                        form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Forms have focus , blur , and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.
                    </li>

                <h3>Ch12: Object Oriented Programming</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ES6 introduced class declarations that use the class keyword. These can be used in place of constructor functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword this refers to the object returned by the function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The prototype is live, so new properties and methods can be added to existing instances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks a method, JavaScript will check whether its prototype has the method.<br>
                        If not, it will check that function’s prototype until it finds the method or reaches the Object constructor function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables using const and defining a function inside a constructor function. These
                        <br>
                        can be made public using getter and setter functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. This should be done with caution as it can
                        <br>
                        cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance chain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Methods can be chained together and called in sequence if they return a reference to this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which can cause errors. This can be worked around by using that = this , using the
                        <br>
                        bind(this) method and using arrow functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Methods can be borrowed from other objects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Composition over inheritance is a design pattern where objects are composed from 'building-block' objects, rather than inheriting all their
                        <br>
                        properties and methods from a parent class.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        npm and Yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript packages, as well as any dependencies that they require.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are responsible for different elements of an application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the

                        closing
