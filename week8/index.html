                <h3>Ch8: Transforms and Transitions</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        CSS3: without a line of JavaScript or a single JPEG, you can tilt, scale, move, and even flip your elements with ease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Transforms:</b> The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Translation:</b> Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Scaling:</b> The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Note that you shouldnâ€™t declare a new transform : because of the cascade, a second transform would override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions. We simply add our scale to the end of that space-separated list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Rotation:</b> 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop. This means that a program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for another task to be completed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it was originally defined in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as a series of functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called from, have no side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments (referential transparency).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a function. A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.
                    </li>

                        Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create your own response objects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or response object.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.
                    </li>
