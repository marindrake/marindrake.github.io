                <h3>Ch8: Transforms and Transitions</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        CSS3: without a line of JavaScript or a single JPEG, you can tilt, scale, move, and even flip your elements with ease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Transforms:</b> The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Translation:</b> Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Scaling:</b> The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Rotation:</b> The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Skew:</b> The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Animations:</b> You can define starting and ending states, but there’s no fine-grained control over any intermediate states.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Keyframes:</b> To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block. Animations in themselves don’t do anything; in order to animate an element, you’ll need to associate the animation with that element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use animations and transitions where it makes sense, enhancing the user experience—and skip it everywhere else.
                    </li>

            <h3>Ch12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Canvas.</b> With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>SVG.</b> SVG stands forScalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down. We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas, including drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns. There are also very useful open-source tools relevant to SVG, some of which we’ll leverage in order to add a spinning progress indicator toThe HTML5 Herald’s geolocation widget.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Canvas versus SVG.</b> If you need to paint pixels to the screen and have no concerns about the ability to retrieve and modify your shapes, canvas is probably the better choice. If, on the other hand, you need to be able to access and change specific aspects of your graphics, SVG might be more appropriate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Drag and Drop</b> This API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
