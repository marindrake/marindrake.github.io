                <h3>MDN: Validating forms.</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called <b>client-side form validation</b>, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When we enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. This is called <b>form validation.</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Validation done in the browser is called <b>client-side</b> validation, while validation done on the server is called <b>server-side</b> validation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll encounter on the web: <b>Built-in form validation</b> uses HTML5 form validation features. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation. 
                        <b>JavaScript validation</b> is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library). 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Client-side form validation sometimes requires JavaScript if you want to customize styling and error messages, but it always requires you to think carefully about the user. Always we need to remember to help our users correct the data they provide. To that end, we need to be sure to: 
                        Display explicit error messages, be permissive about the input format, and Point out exactly where the error occurs, especially on large forms.
                    </li>

                            <h3>Example</h3>
                        </a>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <h3> MDN: Using Fetch.</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.  It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This kind of functionality was previously achieved using XMLHttpRequest. Fetch provides a better alternative that can be easily used by other technologies such as Service Workers. Fetch also provides a single logical place to define other HTTP-related concepts such as CORS and extensions to HTTP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in the following significant ways: The Promise returned from fetch() <b>won’t reject on HTTP error status.</b> fetch() <b>won’t send cross-origin cookies</b> unless you set the credentials init option.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
