            <p>The love test calculates the chances that your love will succeed as a percentage. Find our your chances! But remember, everything is unexpected when it comes to love and we cannot guarantee success, but often persistence is rewarded! Everyone can improve the odds of a relationship with their own behaviour!</p>
